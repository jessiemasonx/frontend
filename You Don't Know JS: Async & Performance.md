# You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance

# Chapter 1: Asynchrony: Now & Later

## A program in chuncks

Your program is almost certainly comprised of several chunks, only one of which is going to execute *now*, and the rest of which will execute *later*. The most common unit of *chunk* is the `function`.

Consider:

```js
// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
var data = ajax( "http://some.url.1" );

console.log( data );
// Oops! `data` generally won't have the Ajax results
```

You're probably aware that standard Ajax requests don't complete synchronously, which means the `ajax(..)` function does not yet have any value to return back to be assigned to `data` variable. If `ajax(..)` *could* block until the response came back, then the `data = ..` assignment would work fine.

But that's not how we do Ajax. We make an asynchronous Ajax request *now*, and we won't get the results back until *later*.

```js
function now() {
	return 21;
}

function later() {
	answer = answer * 2;
	console.log( "Meaning of life:", answer );
}

var answer = now();

setTimeout( later, 1000 ); // Meaning of life: 42
```

There are two chunks to this program: the stuff that will run *now*, and the stuff that will run *later*. It should be fairly obvious what those two chunks are, but let's be super explicit:

Now:
```js
function now() {
	return 21;
}

function later() { .. }

var answer = now();

setTimeout( later, 1000 );
```

Later:
```js
answer = answer * 2;
console.log( "Meaning of life:", answer );
```

The *now* chunk runs right away, as soon as you execute your program. But `setTimeout(..)` also sets up an event (a timeout) to happen *later*, so the contents of the `later()` function will be executed at a later time (1,000 milliseconds from now).

Any time you wrap a portion of code into a `function` and specify that it should be executed in response to some event (timer, mouse click, Ajax response, etc.), you are creating a *later* chunk of your code, and thus introducing asynchrony to your program.

### Async Console

There is no specification or set of requirements around how the `console.*` methods work -- they are not officially part of JavaScript, but are instead added to JS by the *hosting environment*.  
In particular, there are some browsers and some conditions that `console.log(..)` does not actually immediately output what it's given.

A not terribly common, but possible, scenario where this could be *observable* (not from code itself but from the outside):

```js
var a = {
	index: 1
};

// later
console.log( a ); // ??

// even later
a.index++;
```

> Geen idee wat je hier moet laten zien. is het nou 1? Want er wordt __ gedaan dus is t toch 2? IDK

Just be aware of this possible asynchronicity in I/O in case you ever run into issues in debugging where objects have been modified *after* a `console.log(..)` statement and yet you see the unexpected modifications show up.

## Event Loop

The JS engine itself has never done anything more than execute a single chunk of your program at any given moment, when asked to.

"Asked to." By whom? That's the important part!

The JS engine doesn't run in isolation. It runs inside a *hosting environment*, which is for most developers the typical web browser. Over the last several years, JS has expanded beyond the browser into other environments, such as servers, via things like Node.js. In fact, JavaScript gets embedded into all kinds of devices these days, from robots to lightbulbs.

In other words, the JS engine has had no innate sense of *time*, but has instead been an on-demand execution environment for any arbitrary snippet of JS. It's the surrounding environment that has always *scheduled* "events" (JS code executions).

Let's conceptualize it first through some fake-ish code:

```js
// `eventLoop` is an array that acts as a queue (first-in, first-out)
var eventLoop = [ ];
var event;

// keep going "forever"
while (true) {
	// perform a "tick"
	if (eventLoop.length > 0) {
		// get the next event in the queue
		event = eventLoop.shift();

		// now, execute the next event
		try {
			event();
		}
		catch (err) {
			reportError(err);
		}
	}
}
```

As you can see, there's a continuously running loop represented by the `while` loop, and each iteration of this loop is called a "tick." For each tick, if an event is waiting on the queue, it's taken off and executed. These events are your function callbacks.

It's important to note that `setTimeout(..)` doesn't put your callback on the event loop queue. What it does is set up a timer; when the timer expires, the environment places your callback into the event loop, such that some future tick will pick it up and execute it. What if there are already 20 items in the event loop at that moment? Your callback waits. It gets in line behind the others.

## Parallel Threading

It's very common to conflate the terms "async" and "parallel," but they are actually quite different. Remember, async is about the gap between *now* and *later*. But parallel is about things being able to occur simultaneously.

The most common tools for parallel computing are processes and threads. Processes and threads execute independently and may execute simultaneously: on separate processors, or even separate computers, but multiple threads can share the memory of a single process.

```js
function later() {
	answer = answer * 2;
	console.log( "Meaning of life:", answer );
}
```

While the entire contents of `later()` would be regarded as a single event loop queue entry, when thinking about a thread this code would run on, there's actually perhaps a dozen different low-level operations. For example, `answer = answer * 2` requires first loading the current value of `answer`, then putting `2` somewhere, then performing the multiplication, then taking the result and storing it back into `answer`.

### Run-to-Completion

Because of JavaScript's single-threading, the code inside of `foo()` (and `bar()`) is atomic, which means that once `foo()` starts running, the entirety of its code will finish before any of the code in `bar()` can run, or vice versa. This is called "run-to-completion" behavior.

In fact, the run-to-completion semantics are more obvious when `foo()` and `bar()` have more code in them, such as:

```js
var a = 1;
var b = 2;

function foo() {
	a++;
	b = b * a;
	a = b + 3;
}

function bar() {
	b--;
	a = 8 + b;
	b = a * 2;
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", foo );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", bar );
```

Because `foo()` can't be interrupted by `bar()`, and `bar()` can't be interrupted by `foo()`, this program only has two possible outcomes depending on which starts running first -- if threading were present, and the individual statements in `foo()` and `bar()` could be interleaved, the number of possible outcomes would be greatly increased!

## Concurrency

Let's imagine a site that displays a list of status updates (like a social network news feed) that progressively loads as the user scrolls down the list. To make such a feature work correctly, (at least) two separate "processes" will need to be executing *simultaneously*.

The first "process" will respond to `onscroll` events (making Ajax requests for new content) as they fire when the user has scrolled the page further down. The second "process" will receive Ajax responses back (to render content onto the page).

Obviously, if a user scrolls fast enough, you may see two or more `onscroll` events fired during the time it takes to get the first response back and process, and thus you're going to have `onscroll` events and Ajax response events firing rapidly, interleaved with each other.

__Concurrency__ is when two or more "processes" are executing simultaneously over the same period, regardless of whether their individual constituent operations happen *in parallel* (at the same instant on separate processors or cores) or not. You can think of concurrency then as "process"-level (or task-level) parallelism, as opposed to operation-level parallelism (separate-processor threads).

For a given window of time (a few seconds worth of a user scrolling), let's visualize each independent "process" as a series of events/operations:

"Process" 1 (`onscroll` events):
```
onscroll, request 1
onscroll, request 2
onscroll, request 3
onscroll, request 4
onscroll, request 5
onscroll, request 6
onscroll, request 7
```

"Process" 2 (Ajax response events):
```
response 1
response 2
response 3
response 4
response 5
response 6
response 7
```

It's quite possible that an `onscroll` event and an Ajax response event could be ready to be processed at exactly the same *moment*. For example, let's visualize these events in a timeline:

```
onscroll, request 1
onscroll, request 2          response 1
onscroll, request 3          response 2
response 3
onscroll, request 4
onscroll, request 5
onscroll, request 6          response 4
onscroll, request 7
response 6
response 5
response 7
```

But, going back to our notion of the event loop from earlier in the chapter, __JS is only going to be able to handle one event at a time__, so either `onscroll, request 2` is going to happen first or `response 1` is going to happen first, but they cannot happen at literally the same moment. Just like kids at a school cafeteria, no matter what crowd they form outside the doors, they'll have to merge into a single line to get their lunch!

Let's visualize the interleaving of all these events onto the event loop queue.

Event Loop Queue:
```
onscroll, request 1   <--- Process 1 starts
onscroll, request 2
response 1            <--- Process 2 starts
onscroll, request 3
response 2
response 3
onscroll, request 4
onscroll, request 5
onscroll, request 6
response 4
onscroll, request 7   <--- Process 1 finishes
response 6
response 5
response 7            <--- Process 2 finishes
```

"Process 1" and "Process 2" run concurrently (task-level parallel), but their individual events run sequentially on the event loop queue.

By the way, notice how `response 6` and `response 5` came back out of expected order?

### Noninteracting

The single-threaded event loop is one expression of concurrency (there are certainly others, which we'll come back to later).

As two or more "processes" are interleaving their steps/events concurrently within the same program, they don't necessarily need to interact with each other if the tasks are unrelated. **If they don't interact, nondeterminism is perfectly acceptable.**

For example:

```js
var res = {};

function foo(results) {
	res.foo = results;
}

function bar(results) {
	res.bar = results;
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", foo );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", bar );
```

`foo()` and `bar()` are two concurrent "processes," and it's nondeterminate which order they will be fired in. But we've constructed the program so it doesn't matter what order they fire in, because they act independently and as such don't need to interact.

This is not a "race condition" bug, as the code will always work correctly, regardless of the ordering.

### Interaction

Here's a simple example of two concurrent "processes" that interact because of implied ordering, which is only *sometimes broken*:

```js
var res = [];

function response(data) {
	res.push( data );
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", response );
```

The concurrent "processes" are the two `response()` calls that will be made to handle the Ajax responses. They can happen in either-first order.

Let's assume the expected behavior is that `res[0]` has the results of the `"http://some.url.1"` call, and `res[1]` has the results of the `"http://some.url.2"` call. Sometimes that will be the case, but sometimes they'll be flipped, depending on which call finishes first. There's a pretty good likelihood that this nondeterminism is a "race condition" bug.

### Cooperation

Another expression of concurrency coordination is called "cooperative concurrency." Here, the focus isn't so much on interacting via value sharing in scopes (though that's obviously still allowed!). The goal is to take a long-running "process" and break it up into steps or batches so that other concurrent "processes" have a chance to interleave their operations into the event loop queue.

For example, consider an Ajax response handler that needs to run through a long list of results to transform the values. We'll use `Array#map(..)` to keep the code shorter:

```js
var res = [];

// `response(..)` receives array of results from the Ajax call
function response(data) {
	// add onto existing `res` array
	res = res.concat(
		// make a new transformed array with all `data` values doubled
		data.map( function(val){
			return val * 2;
		} )
	);
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", response );
```

If `"http://some.url.1"` gets its results back first, the entire list will be mapped into `res` all at once. If it's a few thousand or less records, this is not generally a big deal. But if it's say 10 million records, that can take a while to run.

While such a "process" is running, nothing else in the page can happen, including no other `response(..)` calls, no UI updates, not even user events like scrolling, typing, button clicking, and the like. That's pretty painful.

So, to make a more cooperatively concurrent system, one that's friendlier and doesn't hog the event loop queue, you can process these results in asynchronous batches, after each one "yielding" back to the event loop to let other waiting events happen.

Here's a very simple approach:

```js
var res = [];

// `response(..)` receives array of results from the Ajax call
function response(data) {
	// let's just do 1000 at a time
	var chunk = data.splice( 0, 1000 );

	// add onto existing `res` array
	res = res.concat(
		// make a new transformed array with all `chunk` values doubled
		chunk.map( function(val){
			return val * 2;
		} )
	);

	// anything left to process?
	if (data.length > 0) {
		// async schedule next batch
		setTimeout( function(){
			response( data );
		}, 0 );
	}
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", response );
```

We process the data set in maximum-sized chunks of 1,000 items. By doing so, we ensure a short-running "process," even if that means many more subsequent "processes," as the interleaving onto the event loop queue will give us a much more responsive (performant) site/app.

## Jobs

So, the best way to think about this that I've found is that the "Job queue" is a queue hanging off the end of every tick in the event loop queue. Certain async-implied actions that may occur during a tick of the event loop will not cause a whole new event to be added to the event loop queue, but will instead add an item (aka Job) to the end of the current tick's Job queue.

It's kinda like saying, "oh, here's this other thing I need to do *later*, but make sure it happens right away before anything else can happen."

> Or, to use a metaphor: the __event loop queue__ is like an amusement park ride, where once you finish the ride, you have to go to the back of the line to ride again. But the __Job queue__ is like finishing the ride, but then cutting in line and getting right back on.

 **later, but as soon as possible**.
 
 et's imagine an API for scheduling Jobs (directly, without hacks), and call it `schedule(..)`. Consider:

```js
console.log( "A" );

setTimeout( function(){
	console.log( "B" );
}, 0 );

// theoretical "Job API"
schedule( function(){
	console.log( "C" );

	schedule( function(){
		console.log( "D" );
	} );
} );
```

You might expect this to print out `A B C D`, but instead it would print out `A C D B`, because the Jobs happen at the end of the current event loop tick, and the timer fires to schedule for the *next* event loop tick (if available!).

## Statement Ordering

What we're about to discuss are **not things you should ever be able to observe** in your JS program.

onsider:

```js
var a, b;

a = 10;
b = 30;

a = a + 1;
b = b + 1;

console.log( a + b ); // 42
```

This code has no expressed asynchrony to it (other than the rare `console` async I/O discussed earlier!), so the most likely assumption is that it would process line by line in top-down fashion.

But it's *possible* that the JS engine, after compiling this code might find opportunities to run your code faster by rearranging (safely) the order of these statements. Essentially, as long as you can't observe the reordering, anything's fair game.

```js
var a, b;

a = 10;
a++;

b = 30;
b++;

console.log( a + b ); // 42
```

But here's a scenario where these specific optimizations would be unsafe and thus couldn't be allowed (of course, not to say that it's not optimized at all):

```js
var a, b;

a = 10;
b = 30;

// we need `a` and `b` in their preincremented state!
console.log( a * b ); // 300

a = a + 1;
b = b + 1;

console.log( a + b ); // 42
```

## Review

A JavaScript program is (practically) always broken up into two or more chunks, where the first chunk runs *now* and the next chunk runs *later*, in response to an event. Even though the program is executed chunk-by-chunk, all of them share the same access to the program scope and state, so each modification to state is made on top of the previous state.

Whenever there are events to run, the *event loop* runs until the queue is empty. Each iteration of the event loop is a "tick." User interaction, IO, and timers enqueue events on the event queue.

At any given moment, only one event can be processed from the queue at a time. While an event is executing, it can directly or indirectly cause one or more subsequent events.

Concurrency is when two or more chains of events interleave over time, such that from a high-level perspective, they appear to be running *simultaneously* (even though at any given moment only one event is being processed).

It's often necessary to do some form of interaction coordination between these concurrent "processes" (as distinct from operating system processes), for instance to ensure ordering or to prevent "race conditions." These "processes" can also *cooperate* by breaking themselves into smaller chunks and to allow other "process" interleaving.

# Chapter 2: Callbacks

## Continuations

```js
// A
ajax( "..", function(..){
	// C
} );
// B
```

`// A` and `// B` represent the first half of the program (aka the *now*), and `// C` marks the second half of the program (aka the *later*). The first half executes right away, and then there's a "pause" of indeterminate length. At some future moment, if the Ajax call completes, then the program will pick up where it left off, and *continue* with the second half.

In other words, the callback function wraps or encapsulates the *continuation* of the program.

## Sequential Brain

When we *fake* multitasking, such as trying to type something at the same time we're talking to a friend or family member on the phone, what we're actually most likely doing is acting as fast context switchers. In other words, we switch back and forth between two or more tasks in rapid succession, *simultaneously* progressing on each task in tiny, fast little chunks. We do it so fast that to the outside world it appears as if we're doing these things *in parallel*.
 __async evented concurrency __
 
 ### Doing Versus Planning
 
 OK, so our brains can be thought of as operating in single-threaded event loop queue like ways, as can the JS engine. That sounds like a good match.
 
 When a developer writes code, they are planning out a set of actions to occur. If they're any good at being a developer, they're **carefully planning** it out. "I need to set `z` to the value of `x`, and then `x` to the value of `y`," and so forth.

When we write out synchronous code, statement by statement, it works a lot like our errands to-do list:

```js
// swap `x` and `y` (via temp variable `z`)
z = x;
x = y;
y = z;
```

These three assignment statements are synchronous, so `x = y` waits for `z = x` to finish, and `y = z` in turn waits for `x = y` to finish. Another way of saying it is that these three statements are temporally bound to execute in a certain order, one right after the other. Thankfully, we don't need to be bothered with any async evented details here. If we did, the code gets a lot more complex, quickly!

So if synchronous brain planning maps well to synchronous code statements, how well do our brains do at planning out asynchronous code?

The reason it's difficult for us as developers to write async evented code, especially when all we have is the callback to do it, is that stream of consciousness thinking/planning is unnatural for most of us.

We think in step-by-step terms, but the tools (callbacks) available to us in code are not expressed in a step-by-step fashion once we move from synchronous to asynchronous.

And **that** is why it's so hard to accurately author and reason about async JS code with callbacks: because it's not how our brain planning works.

### Nested/Chained Callbacks

Consider:

```js
listen( "click", function handler(evt){
	setTimeout( function request(){
		ajax( "http://some.url.1", function response(text){
			if (text == "hello") {
				handler();
			}
			else if (text == "world") {
				request();
			}
		} );
	}, 500) ;
} );
```

This kind of code is often called "callback hell," and sometimes also referred to as the "pyramid of doom" (for its sideways-facing triangular shape due to the nested indentation).

First, we're waiting for the "click" event, then we're waiting for the timer to fire, then we're waiting for the Ajax response to come back, at which point it might do it all again.

At first glance, this code may seem to map its asynchrony naturally to sequential brain planning.

First (*now*), we:

```js
listen( "..", function handler(..){
	// ..
} );
```

Then *later*, we:

```js
setTimeout( function request(..){
	// ..
}, 500) ;
```

Then still *later*, we:

```js
ajax( "..", function response(..){
	// ..
} );
```

And finally (most *later*), we:

```js
if ( .. ) {
	// ..
}
else ..
```

But there's several problems with reasoning about this code linearly in such a fashion.

## Trust Issues

Let's once again revisit the notion of a callback function as the continuation (aka the second half) of our program:

```js
// A
ajax( "..", function(..){
	// C
} );
// B
```

`// A` and `// B` happen *now*, under the direct control of the main JS program. But `// C` gets deferred to happen *later*, and under the control of another party -- in this case, the `ajax(..)` function. In a basic sense, that sort of hand-off of control doesn't regularly cause lots of problems for programs.

But don't be fooled by its infrequency that this control switch isn't a big deal. In fact, it's one of the worst (and yet most subtle) problems about callback-driven design. It revolves around the idea that sometimes `ajax(..)` (i.e., the "party" you hand your callback continuation to) is not a function that you wrote, or that you directly control. Many times, it's a utility provided by some third party.

We call this __inversion of control,__ when you take part of your program and give over control of its execution to another third party. There's an unspoken "contract" that exists between your code and the third-party utility -- a set of things you expect to be maintained.


### Tale of Five Callbacks

It might not be terribly obvious why this is such a big deal. Let me construct an exaggerated scenario to illustrate the hazards of trust at play.

Imagine you're a developer tasked with building out an ecommerce checkout system for a site that sells expensive TVs. You already have all the various pages of the checkout system built out just fine. On the last page, when the user clicks "confirm" to buy the TV, you need to call a third-party function (provided say by some analytics tracking company) so that the sale can be tracked.

You notice that they've provided what looks like an async tracking utility, probably for the sake of performance best practices, which means you need to pass in a callback function. In this continuation that you pass in, you will have the final code that charges the customer's credit card and displays the thank you page.

This code might look like:

```js
analytics.trackPurchase( purchaseData, function(){
	chargeCreditCard();
	displayThankyouPage();
} );
```

One morning, you're at a coffee shop before work, casually enjoying your latte, when you get a panicked call from your boss insisting you drop the coffee and rush into work right away.

When you arrive, you find out that a high-profile customer has had his credit card charged five times for the same TV, and he's understandably upset. Customer service has already issued an apology and processed a refund. But your boss demands to know how this could possibly have happened. "Don't we have tests for stuff like this!?"

ou don't even remember the code you wrote. But you dig back in and start trying to find out what could have gone awry.

After digging through some logs, you come to the conclusion that the only explanation is that the analytics utility somehow, for some reason, called your callback five times instead of once. Nothing in their documentation mentions anything about this.

Frustrated, you contact customer support, who of course is as astonished as you are. They agree to escalate it to their developers, and promise to get back to you. The next day, you receive a lengthy email explaining what they found, which you promptly forward to your boss.

Apparently, the developers at the analytics company had been working on some experimental code that, under certain conditions, would retry the provided callback once per second, for five seconds, before failing with a timeout. They had never intended to push that into production, but somehow they did, and they're totally embarrassed and apologetic. They go into plenty of detail about how they've identified the breakdown and what they'll do to ensure it never happens again. Yadda, yadda.

What's next?

You talk it over with your boss, but he's not feeling particularly comfortable with the state of things. He insists, and you reluctantly agree, that you can't trust them anymore (that's what bit you), and that you'll need to figure out how to protect the checkout code from such a vulnerability again.

After some tinkering, you implement some simple ad hoc code like the following, which the team seems happy with:

var tracked = false;

analytics.trackPurchase( purchaseData, function(){
	if (!tracked) {
		tracked = true;
		chargeCreditCard();
		displayThankyouPage();
	}
} );

### Not Just Others' Code

So, contemplate this: can you even *really* trust utilities that you do theoretically control (in your own code base)?

Think of it this way: most of us agree that at least to some extent we should build our own internal functions with some defensive checks on the input parameters, to reduce/prevent unexpected issues.

Overly trusting of input:
```js
function addNumbers(x,y) {
	// + is overloaded with coercion to also be
	// string concatenation, so this operation
	// isn't strictly safe depending on what's
	// passed in.
	return x + y;
}

addNumbers( 21, 21 );	// 42
addNumbers( 21, "21" );	// "2121"
```

Defensive against untrusted input:
```js
function addNumbers(x,y) {
	// ensure numerical input
	if (typeof x != "number" || typeof y != "number") {
		throw Error( "Bad parameters" );
	}

	// if we get here, + will safely do numeric addition
	return x + y;
}

addNumbers( 21, 21 );	// 42
addNumbers( 21, "21" );	// Error: "Bad parameters"
```

Or perhaps still safe but friendlier:
```js
function addNumbers(x,y) {
	// ensure numerical input
	x = Number( x );
	y = Number( y );

	// + will safely do numeric addition
	return x + y;
}

addNumbers( 21, 21 );	// 42
addNumbers( 21, "21" );	// 42
```

However you go about it, these sorts of checks/normalizations are fairly common on function inputs, even with code we theoretically entirely trust. In a crude sort of way, it's like the programming equivalent of the geopolitical principle of "Trust But Verify."

So, doesn't it stand to reason that we should do the same thing about composition of async function callbacks, not just with truly external code but even with code we know is generally "under our own control"? **Of course we should.**

## Trying to Save Callbacks

Regarding more graceful error handling, some API designs provide for split callbacks (one for the success notification, one for the error notification):

```js
function success(data) {
	console.log( data );
}

function failure(err) {
	console.error( err );
}

ajax( "http://some.url.1", success, failure );

In APIs of this design, often the `failure()` error handler is optional, and if not provided it will be assumed you want the errors swallowed. Ugh.

Another common callback pattern is called "error-first style" (sometimes called "Node style," as it's also the convention used across nearly all Node.js APIs), where the first argument of a single callback is reserved for an error object (if any). If success, this argument will be empty/falsy (and any subsequent arguments will be the success data), but if an error result is being signaled, the first argument is set/truthy (and usually nothing else is passed):

```js
function response(err,data) {
	// error?
	if (err) {
		console.error( err );
	}
	// otherwise, assume success
	else {
		console.log( data );
	}
}

ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
```

In both of these cases, several things should be observed.

First, it has not really resolved the majority of trust issues like it may appear. 
Also, don't miss the fact that while it's a standard pattern you can employ, it's definitely more verbose and boilerplate-ish without much reuse, so you're going to get weary of typing all that out for every single callback in your application.

## Review

Callbacks are the fundamental unit of asynchrony in JS. But they're not enough for the evolving landscape of async programming as JS matures.

First, our brains plan things out in sequential, blocking, single-threaded semantic ways, but callbacks express asynchronous flow in a rather nonlinear, nonsequential way, which makes reasoning properly about such code much harder. Bad to reason about code is bad code that leads to bad bugs.

We need a way to express asynchrony in a more synchronous, sequential, blocking manner, just like our brains do.

Second, and more importantly, callbacks suffer from *inversion of control* in that they implicitly give control over to another party (often a third-party utility not in your control!) to invoke the *continuation* of your program. This control transfer leads us to a troubling list of trust issues, such as whether the callback is called more times than we expect.

Inventing ad hoc logic to solve these trust issues is possible, but it's more difficult than it should be, and it produces clunkier and harder to maintain code, as well as code that is likely insufficiently protected from these hazards until you get visibly bitten by the bugs.

We need a generalized solution to **all of the trust issues**, one that can be reused for as many callbacks as we create without all the extra boilerplate overhead.

We need something better than callbacks. They've served us well to this point, but the *future* of JavaScript demands more sophisticated and capable async patterns. The subsequent chapters in this book will dive into those emerging evolutions.
